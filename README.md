# F1 Drivers Championships
This goes through every Drivers Championship in F1 history and gives drivers points based off their finishes in each year's Drivers Championship as if it were a single race. 
For example, if a driver wins the Drivers Championship they are awarded 25 points, if they come in second they get 18 points, etc.
